# Image-Processing

* C++ coding algorithms behind convolution filters, luminosity, rotation, reflection etc. in Image Processing applications  from scratch.

* This was a class project for a High Performance Computing class that I am taking that I found really interesting and decided to explore further.

* The main focus of the project was to investigate how parallel programming with OpenMp optimizes such tasks, especially where large images are involved. That explains the timing part and the ' #pragma omp parallel for' syntax.

* I compiled and executed the program via a virtual GPU powered computer (virtual computer lab environment) provided by my school for HPC students. 

* Tested out the code on a picture taken somewhere in my school named 'GVSU.pgm'

* The algorithm uses C++ vectors to represent 1D and 2D dimension arrays used for storage and manipulation of image pixels.

* The results can be found on the Imageprocessing_Output.pdf folder.
